# visrc

My dotfiles for vis, configured in fennel, because why not?

## Usage

The plugins I use are handled manually, I `git clone` them in to
my `~/.config/vis/plugins` directory and `(require)` them as needed.

You will also need the fennel bootstrap compiler, either install
it (using your package manager) or download it manually.  If you
decide to install it manually you will need to place the `fennel.lua`
file in your `~/.config/vis/` directory which you can find
[here](https://github.com/bakpakin/Fennel/blob/main/bootstrap/fennel.lua).
